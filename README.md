# Nebius TF Relay

> **Fork notice — kimi-relay.** This repository is a friendly fork of

> (MIT), being rebranded as **kimi-relay**: `klaude` / `kodex` / `openkode`
> launchers for Kimi K3 with a choice of non-Chinese hosting — Nebius Token
> Factory (EU) or Vercel AI Gateway (US) — plus optional
> [Tenki](https://tenki.cloud) sandboxing. See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the roadmap.
> Until the rebrand lands, everything below documents the upstream behavior.

Run your local coding agents on [Nebius Token Factory](https://tokenfactory.nebius.com/) open models. One install, and **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **OpenCode**, and **Pi** all talk to open-weight models (Kimi K3, Kimi K2.6, Qwen 3.5, DeepSeek V4, MiniMax M3) instead of their default backends.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://nebius-tf-relay.vercel.app/install.sh | sh
```

Then:

```bash
nebiusrelay claude     # Claude Code on Nebius models (alias: nclaude)
```

---

## What it does

Nebius Token Factory serves open models over an OpenAI-compatible API. It does **not** speak the Anthropic Messages API (Claude Code) or the OpenAI Responses API (Codex). Nebius TF Relay runs a small local daemon that translates those wire formats to Nebius `/chat/completions` on the fly, so your agent believes it is talking to its native backend while every token is served by Nebius.

- **Proxied harnesses** (Claude Code, Codex): a local daemon translates each request/response, tracks cost, retries transient failures, trims context to fit, and emulates native web search.
- **Spawned harnesses** (OpenCode, Pi): launched with a generated provider config pointed at Nebius, no proxy needed.

Nothing about your agent install changes. The relay injects a base URL and API key per session and writes nothing permanent to your agent's config.

## Install

The one-liner installs the `nebiusrelay`, `nclaude`, `nopencode`, `ncodex`, and `npi` commands to `~/.nebiusrelay/bin/` and installs [Bun](https://bun.sh) for you if it isn't already present:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://nebius-tf-relay.vercel.app/install.sh | sh
```

First run walks you through configuration (or run it directly):

```bash
nebiusrelay configure
```

You'll be asked for two keys:

| Key                | Where to get it                                          | Required?                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Nebius API key** | <https://tokenfactory.nebius.com/?modals=create-api-key> | Yes                           |
| **Tavily API key** | <https://app.tavily.com>                                 | Optional (enables web search) |

Both are stored in `~/.nebiusrelay/` and never leave your machine. You can also set `NEBIUS_API_KEY` / `TAVILY_API_KEY` in the environment instead.

If the underlying agent CLI (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) isn't installed, the relay prints its official install command and exits. It never installs agents for you.

## Usage

Pick a tool interactively:

```bash
nebiusrelay
```

Or launch one directly (each has a short alias):

```bash
nebiusrelay claude       # alias: nclaude
nebiusrelay codex        # alias: ncodex
nebiusrelay opencode     # alias: nopencode
nebiusrelay pi           # alias: npi
nebiusrelay chatgpt      # alpha: ChatGPT Desktop session with restore (alias: codex-app)
```

Any extra arguments are passed straight through to the underlying agent:

```bash
nclaude -p "explain this repo"
ncodex exec "add a test for the parser"
```

## Models

The model list is **fetched live** from Nebius (`GET /v1/models?verbose=true`) at startup, so every model Nebius serves is available and each model's vision support comes straight from the API's modality field, never a hand-maintained list. Results are cached in `~/.nebiusrelay/` and fall back to a bundled snapshot when offline. The default coding model is **Kimi K3**; switch inside your agent or with `--model`.

Featured flagships:

| Model                   | Best for                  | Context | Vision |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| **Kimi K3** _(default)_ | General coding + agentic  | 262K    | No     |
| Kimi K2.6               | Vision flagship           | 262K    | Yes    |
| Kimi K2.7 Code          | Coding                    | 262K    | No     |
| MiniMax M3              | Fast, cheap               | 196K    | No     |
| Qwen 3.5 397B           | General / coding flagship | 262K    | No     |
| DeepSeek V4 Pro         | Long-context reasoning    | 1M      | No     |
| Qwen2.5-VL 72B          | Vision fallback           | 32K     | Yes    |

Claude Code and Codex are text-native; image blocks are auto-routed to a vision-capable model (Kimi K2.6, then Qwen2.5-VL). OpenCode uses a dedicated `@vision` subagent pinned to the vision flagship. Run `scripts/list-nebius-models.mjs` (with `NEBIUS_API_KEY` set) to print the raw catalog Nebius serves.

## Web search

Claude Code and Codex expose a native `web_search` tool. The relay backs it with [Tavily](https://tavily.com): if a Tavily key is configured, searches return real results with citations. Without one, a search returns a clear "TAVILY_API_KEY not set" message instead of failing silently. Nebius has no hosted search tool, so this is how agents get live web access.

## Configuration & env vars

| Variable                           | Effect                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NEBIUS_API_KEY`                   | Nebius Token Factory key (or set via `configure`).                                                                                               |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY`                   | Enables web search (or set via `configure`).                                                                                                     |
| `NEBIUS_BASE_URL`                  | Override the API base (default `https://api.tokenfactory.nebius.com/v1`).                                                                        |
| `NEBIUSRELAY_REASONING_EFFORT`     | `none`\|`low`\|`medium`\|`high`\|`max`. Default `none` for speed; raise for harder tasks.                                                        |
| `NEBIUSRELAY_FALLBACK_MODEL`       | Model to fail over to when the target model returns no response headers (down/overloaded). Default `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6`; set `off` to disable. |
| `NEBIUSRELAY_DISABLE_AUTOUPDATE=1` | Stop the installed binary from self-updating.                                                                                                    |
| `NEBIUSRELAY_TELEMETRY_URL`        | Opt in to telemetry by pointing at your own collector. Off by default.                                                                           |

The installed binary keeps itself up to date from `nebius-tf-relay.vercel.app`, throttled to once an hour, and swallows every failure. Dev/source runs never self-update.

## For AI agents

An LLM-readable doc is published at <https://nebius-tf-relay.vercel.app/llms.txt>. If you are an agent asked to install, configure, or drive nebiusrelay (including headless), read that first. It covers install, configure, every command, the models, and headless usage patterns.

## Local development

Monorepo: pnpm workspaces + Turbo. `packages/cli` (the relay), `packages/models` (the catalog), `packages/tests`, and `site/` (the install/update host).

```bash
pnpm install                       # from repo root
pnpm -F @nebiusrelay/cli build     # build the CLI
pnpm dev                           # rebuild on change (run relay commands from another terminal)
pnpm test                          # offline test suite
```

Run the built CLI directly, or through the workspace bin (closest to how users invoke it):

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/bin/nebiusrelay.js help
pnpm -F @nebiusrelay/cli exec nebiusrelay help
```

Testing commands and live-smoke notes are in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

### Publishing

The install one-liner, the auto-updating bundle, and `llms.txt` are served from the static site in `site/`:

```bash
pnpm build:site        # builds the CLI bundle + latest.json + the site
# deploy site/ to Vercel (or any static host)
```

`scripts/build-bundle.sh` writes `site/public/nebiusrelay.js` (the installed bundle) and `site/public/latest.json` (the self-update manifest). Cut a release with `pnpm bump-version`, rebuild, and redeploy so installed binaries pick it up.
