# Domain Glossary - kimirelay

The ubiquitous language for the kimirelay CLI proxy/router. Terms here are
the canonical names for concepts in the codebase; architecture review and code
discussion should use these words exactly. Architecture vocabulary (module,
interface, depth, seam, adapter, leverage, locality) comes from the
`codebase-design` skill glossary.

## Agents (the harness families)

A **harness** is a Kimi Relay adapter for one coding-agent CLI. There are two
architecturally distinct families (recorded as `ProxiedHarness` and
`SpawnedHarness` in `harness-types.ts`):

- **Proxied harness** - Claude, Codex. `run` spawns a daemon-backed proxy: it
  registers a session, starts a keepalive, routes `/v1/*` traffic through the
  daemon's Nebius client, tracks cost via a `CostTracker`, and deregisters on
  exit. The shared lifecycle lives in `runProxiedSession`
  (`packages/cli/src/lib/proxied-session.ts`).
- **Spawned harness** - OpenCode, Pi. `run` spawns the agent binary directly;
  the binary's own provider plugin talks to Nebius (OpenCode) or reads a
  `models.json` from disk (Pi). No daemon, no proxy, no `CostTracker`, no
  keepalive.

**Harness** - anything that adapts one agent CLI to Kimi Relay. _Avoid:_
integration, connector.

**HarnessId** - the enum of harness identifiers (`claude`, `codex`, `opencode`,
`pi`). Note: the daemon also knows about `codex-app`, a fifth agent id not in
`HarnessId` - an orphan to be reconciled.

## The daemon seam

**Daemon** - the shared, persistent local proxy process (`daemon/server.ts`).
One process serves every proxied session: each registers its token +
credentials at `POST /internal/sessions`, and the daemon resolves every
`/v1/*` request to that session by the presented Bearer token.

**Session** - a registered proxied-harness invocation. A session carries its
own Nebius `apiKey`, model, and `CostTracker`; the daemon owns the session
registry (`SessionRegistry` in `daemon/state.ts`).

**SessionRegistry** - the in-memory + sqlite-backed registry of active
sessions. Exported and injectable into `runDaemon` so it's testable in
isolation (#5: the interface is the test surface).

**SessionStore** - the persistence adapter behind the registry
(`daemon/storage.ts`). Deep module: hides Bun/Node sqlite detection, the schema,
migrations, and resilience behind a 7-method interface.

## The Nebius client seam

**Nebius client** (`nebius-client.ts`) - the deep HTTP client for
`POST /chat/completions`. Owns the fetch + 429/503 retry loop + backoff. Each
harness's `nebius-call.ts` maps the response to its own wire-format error
shape on top (Anthropic vs OpenAI Responses).

**Wire format** - the request/response shape an agent CLI speaks. Claude speaks
the Anthropic Messages API (`/v1/messages`); Codex speaks the OpenAI Responses
API (`/v1/responses`). The translation lives in each harness's
`translate-request.ts` / `translate-response.ts` / `stream.ts`.

**Error contract** - each harness renders errors in its own wire shape. The
daemon's catch-all dispatches by `session.agent` and renders Anthropic errors
for Claude, OpenAI errors for Codex (#2: was a bug - Codex errors were
mis-rendered as Anthropic).

## Cross-cutting

**CostTracker** (`cost.ts`, shared) - proxy-side token + dollar tracking using
the selected model's rates. Self-calibrating token estimator. Lives at the
shared seam (not under any harness tree).

**proxied-session** (`proxied-session.ts`) - the shared 15-step lifecycle for a
proxied harness: model resolve → daemon → register → telemetry → banner →
spawn → pid update → keepalive → await exit → cost print → deregister.

**paths** (`paths.ts`, shared) - the single source of truth for the kimirelay
home directory + process-liveness check. Replaces 4+3 duplicated copies.
